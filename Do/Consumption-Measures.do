// When examining the life cycle profile of mean
// expenditures and cross-sectional dispersion, we limit our analysis to nondurables
// excluding health and education expenditures. Our measure of
// nondurables consists of expenditure on food (both home and away), alcohol,
// tobacco, clothing and personal care, utilities, domestic services,
// nondurable transportation, airfare, nondurable entertainment, net gambling
// receipts, business services, and charitable giving.7We also examine a
// broader measure of nondurables that includes housing services, where
// housing services are calculated as either rent paid (for renters) or the selfreported
// rental equivalent of the respondentâ€™s house (for homeowners).

* PSID: we do same as AH but do not have tobacco, clothing and personal care,
