Next steps
-drop cohort dummies, add fixed effects
-Integrate APC results with previous work on the impact of retirement
-Include a discontinuity for retirement (cannot have time trend around retirement due to fixed effects and time trend)

Then look at heterogeneity in life cycle consumption profiles
-Pat - I'm a bit concerned by downward trend in trips expenditure
-What if we produce results based on "permanent income" quartiles? Define these quartiles by computing income percentile by age and year, then average over our observations for each HH

Overall thought:
-estimate life cycle model with necessities / luxuries

Thoughts on housing regression. Three options
- 1 - APC without fixed effect. Then add a "time to buying" dummy and discontinuity
- 2 - AP with HH fixed effect. Add a dummy for "time to buying" -1 to -3 and another for -4 to -6
- 3 - AP with HH fixed effect. Add "time to buying" as a continuous variable, plus "time to buying"^2
